# Test file for data loader 
"""
Author: Luis Nieto Hueso  
Date: 28/03/2025  
Description:  
This test script verifies the functionality of the `load_and_preprocess_data` function from the data loading module.  
It ensures that a CSV file is correctly read and pre-processed â€” particularly focusing on the 'Time' column.

Function: `test_load_and_preprocess_data()`  
- Loads data from a sample CSV file (the path should be updated as required).  
- Asserts that the result is a valid pandas DataFrame.  
- Checks for the presence of the 'Time' column to confirm successful pre-processing.  
- Ensures that the dataset is not empty after loading.

Testing Tools and Libraries:  
- `pytest` for running the test  
- `pandas` for DataFrame assertions  
- `load_and_preprocess_data` from the data module for actual logic under test

This test helps confirm that the initial data ingestion and timestamp parsing behave reliably  
before further transformation or modelling takes place.
