Description:
This utility script is responsible for generating both a markdown summary and a visual plot of fuel cost reduction analysis.
It is designed to complement the `analyze_fuel_cost_reduction()` function by exporting the results in a human-readable format
for reporting or testing purposes.

Function: `generate_fuel_summary_report()`
- Takes a dictionary of fuel-related metrics (e.g., fuel cost before/after optimisation, consumption, percentage reduction).
- Writes a markdown file (`fuel_summary.md`) summarising the results with a timestamp.
- The file is automatically saved in the `tests/outputs` directory, which is created if it doesnâ€™t already exist.
- Useful for audit trails, documentation, and regression testing.

Function: `generate_fuel_summary_plot()`
- Produces a simple bar chart comparing fuel cost before and after optimisation.
- Labels each bar with the dollar amount and saves the figure as a PNG file in the specified path.
- Visually illustrates the benefit of route optimisation for presentations or summary reports.

The script uses:
- `os` for directory creation
- `datetime` to timestamp reports
- `matplotlib.pyplot` for visualisation

Together, these functions provide a lightweight reporting system for fuel and cost performance in waste management logistics.
