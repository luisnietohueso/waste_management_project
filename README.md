# ♻️ Smart Urban Waste Management System

This project is part of my final year Computer Science degree at the University of Greenwich. The goal is to develop a **smart, data-driven urban waste management system** that optimises bin collection using real-time IoT data, machine learning models, and route planning algorithms.

## 📌 Project Overview

Traditional waste collection methods are often inefficient and costly. This system uses **IoT-enabled bins**, **historical data**, and **machine learning** to predict waste levels and recommend the most efficient routes for waste collection trucks — saving time, fuel, and operational costs.

## 🧠 Key Features

- 📡 **IoT Integration:** Simulates sensor data to track bin fill levels
- 🧮 **Machine Learning Models:** Predict bin overflow using HMMs & RNNs
- 🗺️ **Route Optimisation:** GIS-based shortest path algorithm for collection trucks
- 📊 **Dashboard Interface:** Real-time visualisation of bins and alerts
- 🛠️ **Modular Codebase:** Built in Python with reusable components

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **ML Models:** HMM (Hidden Markov Model), RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)  
- **Data Handling:** Pandas, NumPy  
- **Mapping & Routes:** Folium, OpenStreetMap, NetworkX  
- **APIs & Testing:** Flask, Postman, Git, Jupyter  
- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub
